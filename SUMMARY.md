**EMDS-6: Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Sixth Version** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 840 images with 840 labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes including *actinophrys*, *arcella*, *aspidisca*, and other: *codosiga*, *colpoda*, *epistylis*, *euglypha*, *paramecium*, *rotifera*, *vorticella*, *noctiluca*, *ceratium*, *stentor*, *siprostomum*, *keratella quadrala*, *euglena*, *gymnodinium*, *gonyaulax*, *phacus*, *stylongchia*, and *synchaeta*.

Images in the Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the CN-GER-AU joint research group.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
